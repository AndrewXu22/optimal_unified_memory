Paragraph explaining Weka:

To facilitate the workflow we have written a script in c++ that allows us to build models, test them and train them seamlessly. 
The script is run on the command line and takes in either csv or arff (Wekaâ€™s proprietary file format) files of test data and
build models using Weka that can be tested on other labelled data or used to make predictions on unlabelled data. The script
handles the formatting of data and models appropriately and allows for the automation of the offline training proportion of 
Xplacer.
